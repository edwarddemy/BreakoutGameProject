The purpose of this project was simply to increase my understanding and knowledge of the Unity Game Engine. This is my second game project using Unity. 

## Overview
This is a simple "Breakout" game where players are given a paddle to control and must knock out the blocks in the air. If the ball falls behind the paddle, the player will lose a life, and their score will be affected. There is a level progression system where players start with an easy level, and go up to harder levels. 

This project incorporates:
  - Physics based collision using colliders and RigidBody components on the ball and objects
  - Code was designed for scalability. New levels can easily be added without much work.
  - Ability to be played on Android

- Settings menu
- After not colliding with anything, the ball will begin to fall down so it won't be stuck bouncing between the boundary walls.
- In-game pause menu with options to restart or exit game
- Victory/Defeat screen showing score and more options
